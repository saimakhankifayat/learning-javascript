/*Logic  for Student Grade Calculator:

Create a "student" object with name, grades (array), and calculateAverage method.
In the method, use a for loop to sum grades, converting each to a Number.
Calculate the average and use if-else to assign a letter grade (e.g., >90 = A, 80-89 = B).
Return a string with the result using string templates.*/

let student ={

  name : "Saima Kifayat Khan",
  grades: [85, 92, 78, 88, 90],
    //calculateAverage method (dad will help me in this cuz i don't understand the logic)
}
